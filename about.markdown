## About me

I am a self taught hobby developer from Germany.
I have experience in .NET, C++ and Java, my most used language is C#. I do regular reverse engineering for my position as a file analyzer at UnknownCheats.

I began coding in 2014. Trough friends I learned about gamehacking which not soon after lead me to writing my own gamehacks.
I also got into reverse engineering and soon found a fascination in code obfuscation and anti cheating software.
<br>
These special interests led me to UnknownCheats were I became a
staff member in 2019. Till this day I remain in the team as a file analyzer and moderator. 
<br>
My current interest is focussed arround cybersecurity especially malware analysis, AV/EDR evasion and use/abuse of C# in said topics.
<br>
Other interests include gaming, sports, formula one and listening to music.
