<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I am a self taught hobby developer from Germany. I am currently enrolled in university studying computer science.
I have experience in .NET, C++ and Java, my most used language is C#. I do regular reverse engineering for my position as a file analyzer at UnknownCheats.</p>

<p>I began coding in 2014. Trough my older brother I learned about gamehacking which not soon after lead me to writing my own gamehacks.
I also got into reverse engineering and soon found a fascination in code obfuscation and anti cheating software.
<br />
These special interests led me to UnknownCheats were I became a
staff member in 2019. Till this day I remain in the team as a file analyzer and moderator. 
<br />
My current interest is focussed arround cybersecurity especially malware analysis, AV/EDR evasion and use/abuse of C# in said topics.
<br />
I am enrolled in a German university studying computer science. Other interests include gaming, sports, formula one and listening to music.</p>
